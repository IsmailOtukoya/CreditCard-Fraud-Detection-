# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection-
Overview
This project implements a fraud detection model to identify and address fraudulent activities in financial transactions. The model employs a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques, forming an ensemble to harness the strengths of individual models.

Models Included
Logistic Regression: A simple yet interpretable linear model providing a baseline for comparison.

Random Forest: A robust ensemble method of decision trees, excelling in capturing complex relationships.

XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm known for its predictive accuracy and ability to handle non-linear patterns.

Neural Network: A deep learning model designed to learn intricate patterns and enhance fraud detection.

Usage
Dependencies: Install required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Training Models: Execute scripts for each model: train_logistic_regression.py, train_random_forest.py, train_xgboost.py, train_neural_network.py.

Ensemble Model: Combine individual models to create an ensemble using create_ensemble.py.

Evaluation: Evaluate the ensemble model on the validation set with evaluate_ensemble.py.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning scripts are available for each model.

Future Improvements
Future improvements include obtaining a broader range of fraud-related data, collecting more details on fraud scenarios, and exploring additional features to enhance model performance.

Contribution
Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome. Open issues or submit pull requests to help enhance the fraud detection system.
